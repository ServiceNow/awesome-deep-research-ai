## Deep Research Agents

### General Deep Research Agents
- [OpenManus](https://github.com/mannaandpoem/OpenManus) which "can achieve any idea without an Invite Code".
- [OpenManus-RL](https://github.com/OpenManus/OpenManus-RL)  an open-source project dedicated to reinforcement learning (RL)- based (such as GRPO) tuning methods for LLM agents, developed collaboratively by researchers from UIUC and OpenManus.
- [Manus: China's Autonomous AI Agent](https://www.forbes.com/sites/craigsmith/2025/03/08/chinas-autonomous-agent-manus-changes-everything/) â€“ An overview of Manus, an autonomous AI agent developed by the Chinese startup Monica, capable of independently carrying out complex real-world tasks without direct or continuous human guidance.
- [Open Operator](https://github.com/browserbase/open-operator) is a free, open-source alternative for AI-driven browser automation.

### Almost Deep Research Agents
- [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT) - An experimental open-source application showcasing GPT-4 running fully autonomously.
- [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) - A simple task management system powered by GPT-based agents.

### Specialized AI Research Assistants

- [Elicit](https://elicit.org/) - AI-powered literature review and research automation.
- [PaperQA](https://github.com/Future-House/paper-qa) - AI-driven paper-based Q&A system for research.
- [ResearchRabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/) - AI tool for discovering and tracking academic papers.
- [CAMEL](https://github.com/lightaime/camel) - Cooperative AI agents working on research-driven tasks.
